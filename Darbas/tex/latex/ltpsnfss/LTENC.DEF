%% IMPORTANT COPYRIGHT NOTICE: 
%% 
%% You are NOT ALLOWED to distribute this file alone.

%% You are allowed to distribute this file under the condition that it is

%% 
%% If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!

%% Permission is granted to copy this file to another file with a clearly

%% 
%% MODIFICATION ADVICE: 
%% 
%% If you want to customize this file, it is best to make a copy of the 
%% source file(s) from which it was produced. Use a different name for 
%% your copy(ies) and modify the copy(ies); this will ensure that your 
%% modifications do not get overwritten when you install a new release of 
%% the standard system. You should also ensure that your modified source 
%% file does not generate any modified file with the same name as a 
%% standard file. You can then easily distribute your modifications by 
%% distributing the modified and renamed copy of the source file, taking 
%% care to observe the conditions in legal.txt; this will ensure that 
%% other users can safely use your modifications. 
%% 
%% You will also need to produce your own, suitably named, .ins file to 
%% control the generation of files from your source file; this file 
%% should contain your own preambles for the files it generates, not 
%% those in the standard .ins files. 
%% 
%% The names of the source files used are shown above.
